Limitless Communication: All-in-one, super scalable, messaging Solution for WordPress.

== Description ==

[Check out the Github Repository ‚ô•](https://github.com/Souptik2001/wp-messaging)

**Limitless Communication:** All-in-one, super scalable, messaging Solution for WordPress.

Ok hold on! ‚úã. So, many words in one line.
Let's understand each one-by-one.

- **All-in-one:** What do you want? - Email, SMS, push-notification? Get all-in-one.
  - But can I don't want to use `xyz` provider for SMS, I want to use `pqr`, can I have that? Yes it provides you with lot of pre implemented providers for all email, sms and push-notification.
- **Super Scalable:** But I want to use an email provider named `yxr` you haven't heard the name of. Now what? üßê
  - No worries! Are you a developer? If yes, just write your own plugin and implement your own adapter and see it nicely hooked-up with "WordPress messaging". Please refer to this section for implementing adapters.

And that's how it provides **Limitless communication**! üöÄ

### Examples

#### Email üìßüì®

Send an email through a particular adapter (with headers üòâ) -

`
\Souptik\WPMessaging\Email\send(
  [ 'dev2@souptik.dev' ],
  'Yay its working!',
  'This is some long mail body.',
  'Souptik',
  'dev1@souptik.dev',
  [
   'cc' => [
    [
     'name'  => 'CC Test',
     'email' => 'cc@souptik.dev',
    ],
   ],
   'attachments' => [
    trailingslashit( WP_CONTENT_DIR ) . '/mu-plugins/test-wp-messaging.php',
     'SameFileDifferentName.php' => trailingslashit( WP_CONTENT_DIR ) . '/mu-plugins/test-wp-messaging.php',
   ],
  ],
  'mailgun'
 );
`

Just remove the last parameter! And now it uses the default selected adapter -

`
\Souptik\WPMessaging\Email\send(
  [ 'dev2@souptik.dev' ],
  'Yay its working!',
  'This is some long mail body.',
  'Souptik',
  'dev1@souptik.dev',
  [
   'cc' => [
    [
     'name'  => 'CC Test',
     'email' => 'cc@souptik.dev',
    ],
   ],
   'attachments' => [
    trailingslashit( WP_CONTENT_DIR ) . '/mu-plugins/test-wp-messaging.php',
     'SameFileDifferentName.php' => trailingslashit( WP_CONTENT_DIR ) . '/mu-plugins/test-wp-messaging.php',
   ],
  ],
 );
`

Checked the override `wp_mail` checkbox? Try a simple `wp_mail`! -

`
wp_mail(
  [ 'dev2@souptik.dev' ],
  'Yay its working!',
  'This is some long mail body - from <strong>wp_mail</strong>.',
  [],
  []
 );
`

#### SMS üì≤

Send a SMS through a particular adapter -

`
\Souptik\WPMessaging\SMS\send( [ '+xxxxxxxxxxxx' ], 'Yay its working!', 'twilio' );
`

Just remove the last parameter! And now it uses the default selected adapter -

`
\Souptik\WPMessaging\SMS\send( [ '+xxxxxxxxxxxx' ], 'Yay its working!' );
`
